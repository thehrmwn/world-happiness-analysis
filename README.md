### üí° Introduction
#### Context
<p>
  The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, 
  the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, 
  was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain 
  global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. 
  Leading experts across fields ‚Äì economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more ‚Äì describe how 
  measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world 
  today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

#### Content
<p>
  The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation address 
  inquired within the survey. This address, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for 
  them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally 
  representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the 
  happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors ‚Äì economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of 
  corruption, and generosity ‚Äì contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country 
  that has values equal to the world‚Äôs lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for 
  each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

 The Happiness Score is a national average of the responses to the main life evaluation question asked in the Gallup World Poll (GWP), 
 which uses the Cantril Ladder.
